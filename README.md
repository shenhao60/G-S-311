# G&S 311
In Chapter 2 of G&S, Example 3.11 uses the binomial distribution to demonstrate the logic of hypothesis testing with a simple example. 
The intuitive simplicity of the example and the availability of tools in R for calculations and plotting distributions encourages you to explore hypothesis testing by reproducing the results presented in the book. 
In the final paragraph of the example on page 102, the authors write, ”A few experiments have shown us that ... ”. They report the results but don’t show you their experiments. Similarly, they show you Figure 3.7, but not how it was produced. 

Your assignment is to fill in these gaps. Produce an explanation of the example showing how the authors reached their conclusion that the critical value should be between 69 and 73 people cured. Replicate and explain Figure 3.7.
